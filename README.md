#MonkeyGame

The Monkey Game is a research project that was designed working with the Cognitive Development Labs at Wesleyan University. The idea behind the application is to observe pre-school-aged children's number recognition skills by engaging them with images that are programmed into the game.

The project pioneered the implementation of mobile technology in a research field at Wesleyan University and
 therefore, part of my responsibility working on this project was also to train and tutor lab members in
 Objective-C.
